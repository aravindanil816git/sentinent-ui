# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Running the Project

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd sentinent-ui-react
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. **Start the development server**

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

The application will start running at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.
